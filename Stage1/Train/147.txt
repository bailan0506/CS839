Labour accused of broken pledge

Labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card, the Tories have claimed.

Home Secretary ^Charles Clarke^ has been quoted as telling Labour members he wants more migrants to come to the UK. Tory co-chairman ^Liam Fox^ said the comments were at odds with ^Tony Blair^'s <prediction of a net cut> in immigration. But Mr ^Clarke^ accused him of trying to score "cheap political points" by muddling immigration with asylum.

London's Evening Standard quoted Mr ^Clarke^ telling <Labour activists> at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. "That's not <only a> moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is <part of> the essence of this country," he said.
