Guantanamo four questioned

The four Britons freed from US custody in Guantanamo Bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.

^Moazzam Begg^, ^Martin Mubanga^, ^Feroz Abbasi^ and ^Richard Belmar^ were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links. Mr ^Begg^'s father, ^Azmat^, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was "a hero". The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers. But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr ^Abbasi^ and Mr ^Mubanga^, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, ^Azmat Begg^ said he was concerned for his son ^Moazzam^'s mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. As ^Azmat Begg^ arrived at the London police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir ^John Stevens^ said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was "absolutely" inadmissible in UK courts. In an interview with the Independent, Sir ^John^ said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK.
