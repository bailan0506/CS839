^Mandelson^ warns BBC on ^Campbell^

The BBC should steer away from "demonising" ex-Downing Street media chief ^Alastair Campbell^, ^Peter Mandelson^ has said.

The <European commissioner> and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr ^Campbell^ is part of a Labour "dirty tricks" campaign. That charge was denied by Mr ^Mandelson^, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr ^Campbell^'s campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr ^Campbell^ had brought it trouble before. That was a reference to the ^Hutton^ inquiry following a BBC story claiming <Downing Street> "sexed up" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.

The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman ^Gavyn Davies^, director-general ^Greg Dyke^ and reporter ^Andrew Gilligan^. <Labour> has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader ^Michael Howard^'s past.
